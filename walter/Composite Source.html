<b>Purpose:</b><br />
	The Mule Studio Palette has a category of components called Scopes. You can think of a scope as a context in which you group other components to do some set of operations. A good example of a context is an asynchronous block of code; that is, code that executes separately while the main application processing continues. In Mule Studio, you can use an Async scope to start a secondary flow from within an application flow and have it execute simultaneously along with the main flow.
