<h1 class="topictitle1">String-to-Byte-Array Reference</h1>

<p>
<b>Purpose:</b><br />
	Transformers let you easily move a message between application processors that work on different types of data.
</p>
<p>
<b>Discussion:</b><br />
	You place a Transformer between any two message processors in a flow where you need to convert data to a different format so that the destination processor can handle it.
</p>
<p>
Standard transformers are configured for you by default. However, you can use the Pattern Properties dialogs for these standard transformers to optionally configure advanced properties. Most transformers, standard or custom, have similar Pattern Properties dialogs, although some transformers have additional configurable properties.
</p>

<p>Using the Pattern Properties dialog Advanced tab, you can optionally configure the properties shown below for most standard transformers:
</p>
<img src="../images/transformer-props.png" alt="" width="300" border="0">
<ul>
<li>Return class: The class of the message generated by the transformer. Specify this class if you are using an auto-generated transformer and you want to ensure that the transformer returns the correct type.</li>
<li>Ignore Bad Input: Check this box to ignore bad input. Many times, a flow will have a chain of transformers. If this box is not checked, then if a transformer is called with the wrong type of data no further transformers in the chain are called and the content as it has been converted up to that point is kept. If this box is checked, then the content is sent to the next transformer in the chain.</li>
<li>Encoding: Select a desired encoding from the pull-down list. You can choose from different ISO standard Unicode and language formats.</li>
<li>Mime Type: Select a MIME type from the pull-down list. MIME (or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is an Internet standard that describes content type. Content types range from different text types, application types, image types, through binary types.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some transformers, both standard and custom transformers such as Custom and Expression Transformer, have additional properties that you can configure. For example, XML-to-Object and Object-to-XML Transformers let you specify aliases and converters. See a transformer's specific reference page for configuring these additional properties.
